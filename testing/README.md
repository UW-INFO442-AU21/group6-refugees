# Browser Testing Protocol

After developing high fidelity wireframes on our Figma, our team conducted user testing on four individuals. We did this either in-person or zoom, and focused on the usability of our product. Either Ethan or Angelina would moderate the test and would use a "Thinking Aloud Testing" process. This meant that either moderator would ask the participant to verbally explain each action that they make to help them better understand how they are navigating the application. 

## User Testing Script

In order to keep each interview controlled, our team wrote a script to ask each participant. 

### Intro 

Today we will be showing you the prototype of another team in our class, and they’ll be testing ours. This way you can give us both positive and/or negative objective feedback about the designs because we didn’t design any of them. The most important thing is that you know that if we have any issues going through these designs, those issues are the fault of the design, not yours!

Let’s jump into it, I’ll just be showing you some screens and asking you to perform some tasks and asking you questions throughout. It would be best if you could say what you’re doing while you’re doing it and why. Because this might feel unnatural, I’ll do my best to remind you throughout!

### Tasks

## Testing Results 

The main feedback we received was about our product's color and typography. For the seriousness of our product, our colors seemed too "fun" or "distracting" to allow users to focus on the information presented to them. We had suggestions to make our "view more" page for groups to instead be an accordion style versus our current modal view for mobile phones. Besides these two points, our testing generally was positive and highlighted the ease of use and accessibility of it all.
