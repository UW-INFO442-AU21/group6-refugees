Perhaps you still have your driver's license or a student identity card. You're also expected to prove that you were persecuted or fear persecution on the basis of your religion, race, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group. Your own sworn statement is a good starting point, as are other personal affidavits from friends, relatives, doctors, or anyone in an official position. If you have any membership cards or documents from your group, make copies of those. But not all the evidence needs to be so personalized; some evidence can simply show the human rights conditions within your country, in order to make the point that you would face the same treatment as others in your position. For example, good forms of evidence might include newspaper articles or reports by human rights organizations such as Amnesty International or Human Rights Watch. Try to keep these reports relevant to your case. For example, if you're a man who was beaten during student protests, find articles describing beatings at student protests -- but don't bother with articles talking about, for example, persecution of women."

The decision may rest on the officer's perception that you are telling the truth (are credible)."
