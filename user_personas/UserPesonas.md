# User Personas

During our design process, our team first created three user personas. These three user personas would be RAUWR's ideal users, which would be UW Students and Faculty who are wanting to learn more about refugee and asylees. Our personas are from the understanding of our team's own student perspectives. With our team being part of various clubs/organizations and coming from different backgrounds, we were able to create personas of various demographics and psychographics. 

They can be seen as Tim Booker, Abi Lee, and Professor Patricia. Since RAUWR is targeted towards UW students and faculty, all three personas are affiliated with the University. 

## Persona Descriptions 

Each persona has an about section that discusses their past history at the UW or current job occupation. They all want to get involved in volunteering and have various experience with it. Additionally, our team made sure that we would understand different motivations of technology potential users could have. Each persona thus has various comfortability of working with technology. With Tim having the highest comfort and Abi having the lowest. Along with their motivations, we made sure to state their goals with volunteering and frustrations that limit them from reaching them.
